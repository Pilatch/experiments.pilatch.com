            Each web component was responsible for positioning the cards contained within it, which was great for abstraction and separation of concerns.
            However it failed because the concept of moving a card from the hand to the placed card area didn't apply in virtual DOM.
            The renderer would destroy the card that was in the hand, and re-make it at its destination.
            That didn't play well with animations, as cards would just pop in and out of existence.""" ]
