    <h2>Exploding Animations</h2>
    <p>
      Though placing a card on the table is a single, visual action, it takes two separate renders to make it happen smoothly and not encumber your program's model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concretely, the server would send a message to the clients, saying "Player one placed the first card in her hand on the table."
      Then client-side code would split that animation into the steps that it needs to render:
      <ol>
        <li>Add the <code>placed</code> attribute to the first card in hand while decrementing the other cards' hand-indicies.</li>
        <li>Rearrange the DOM to match the new game state after the transition is complete.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      The server sends high-level updates of the game state via <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a>, which Elm decodes from JSON into a type like <code>AnimationFromServer</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>explode</code> function knows the render steps that make an animation look good on screen.
      Those steps get crammed into the model.
